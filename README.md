## About

Hi, I’m IceWaffles - you can also find me on discord at IceWaffles#3175 !
I’m currently running a semi-vanilla survival server!
I'll be uploading some files-extremely basic optimised configs for a vanilla style (default minecraft survival) server.

Note: These configs are as close to vanilla/default behaviour as possible. With my config, you'll notice no/negligible changes to the game other than performance improvements when compared to the default values! There's obviously heavier optimisation guides, but then you may start to notice some (minor) game changing things. For example, they may recommend to nerf spawner mobs, in which case they essentially lose their AI and no longer behave like normal mobs.



## Installation [1.18.x]

Use the files attached at the top of this page and copy and paste them into your own! For example, if you run paper, replace your `paper.yml` with the text from my `paper.yml` attached above. The same goes for the other two: replace your `spigot.yml` and `bukkit.yml` with text from my `spigot.yml` and `bukkit.yml`. Of course, if you're running Spigot, then you only need to replace your `spigot.yml` and `bukkit.yml` as you don't have a `paper.yml`.



## Server JAR

<10 players - [Vanilla](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/) | Standard minecraft software distributed by Mojang.

10-15 players - [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) | Allows use of plugins! Based off Bukkit (now CraftBukkit) while bringing in a few optimisations.

15-50 players - [Paper](https://papermc.io/) | Provides dupe and bug fixes over vanilla minecraft. Has merged in Tuinity for a massive performance boost! <br />

50-100 players - [Pufferfish](https://ci.pufferfish.host/job/Pufferfish-1.18/) | Insane performance and optimisations. Do NOT use unless you have a very large server and must have the extra performance.

50-100 players - [Purpur](https://purpurmc.org) | Based off Pufferfish-only use if you need it's configuration options! Not recommended if you generally want a 'vanilla' MC experience. <br />



## Other


Timings is a simple way to see exactly what is lagging your server! You probably will need to utilise it when asking for suppirt. As it's (v2) built into Paper, you just need to execute the `/timings paste` command and click the link you're provided with. If you don't understand yet, there is a detailed [video tutorial by Aikar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4J0A9l7bfQ) on how to read them.
  
[Spark](https://github.com/lucko/spark) is a plugin that takes a deeper dive and allows you to profile your server's CPU and memory usage! You can read on how to use it [on its wiki](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/).
