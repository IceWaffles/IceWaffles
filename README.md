## About Me

Hi, I’m IceWaffles - you can also find me on discord at IceWaffles#3175 !
I’m currently running a semi-vanilla survival server!
I'll be uploading some files-extremely basic optimised configs for a vanilla style (default minecraft survival) server.

Note: These configs are as close to vanilla/default behaviour as possible. With my config, you'll notice no/negligible changes to the game other than performance improvements when compared to the default values! There's obviously heavier optimisation guides, but then you may start to notice some (minor) game changing things. For example, they may have you to recommend to nerf spawner mobs, in which case they essentially lose their AI and no longer behave like normal mobs.



## Installation

<10 players - [Vanilla](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/) | Standard minecraft software distributed by Mojang.

10-15 players - [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) | Allows use of plugins! Based off Bukkit (now CraftBukkit) while bringing in a few optimisations.

15-50 players - [Paper](https://papermc.io/) | Provides dupes and bug fixes over vanilla minecraft. Recently merged in Tuinity for a massive performance boost! <br />

50-100 players - [Airplane](https://airplane.gg/) | Insane performance and optimisations. Do NOT use unless you have a very large server and must have the extra performance.

50-100 players - [Purpur](https://purpur.pl3x.net/downloads/) | Based off Airplane-only use if you need it's configuration options! Not recommended if you generally want a 'vanilla' MC experience. <br />
