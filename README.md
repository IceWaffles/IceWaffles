## About Me

Hi, I’m IceWaffles - you can also find me on discord at IceWaffles#3175 !
I’m currently running a semi-vanilla survival server!
I'll be uploading some files-extremely basic optimised configs for a vanilla style (default minecraft survival) server.



## Installation

<10 players - [Vanilla](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/) | Standard minecraft software distributed by Mojang.

10-15 players - [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) | Allows use of plugins! Based off Bukkit (now CraftBukkit) 

15-50 players - [Paper](https://papermc.io/) | Provides dupes and bug fixes over vanilla minecraft! Recently merged in Tuinity for a massive performance boost! <br />

50-100 - [Airplane](https://airplane.gg/) | Insane performance and optimisations. Do NOT use unless you have a very large server and must have the extra performance.

50-100 players - [Purpur](https://purpur.pl3x.net/downloads/) | Based off Airplane-only use if you need it's configuration options! Not recommended if you generally want a 'vanilla' MC experience. <br />
