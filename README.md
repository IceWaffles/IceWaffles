## About Me

Hi, I’m @IceWaffles - you can also find me on discord at IceWaffles#3175 !
I’m currently running a semi-vanilla survival server!
I'll be uploading some basic files-eg very basic optimised configs for a public vanilla server.



-------------------------------------------------------

## Installation

<10 players - vanilla | Standard minecraft software distributed by Mojang.
10-15 players - [Spigot] (https://spigotmc.org)| Allows use of plugins! Based off Bukkit (now CraftBukkit) <br /> 
15-25 players - [Paper](https://papermc.io/) | Provides dupes and bug fixes over vanilla minecraft! Also a performance boost over spigot. <br />
25-50 players - [Tuinity](https://ci.codemc.io/job/Spottedleaf/job/Tuinity/) | 'Experimental' and 'heavy' optimisations. Fork of paper, which means it includes the dupes and bug fixes. <br />
25-50 players - [Purpur](https://purpur.pl3x.net/downloads/) | Based off Tuinity-only use if you need it's configuration options! Not recommended if you generally want a 'vanilla' MC experience. <br />
50-100 - [Airplane](https://airplane.gg/) | Insane performance and optimisations. Do NOT use unless you have a very large server and must have the extra performance.
