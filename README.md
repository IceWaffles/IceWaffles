- Hi, I’m @IceWaffles - you can also find me on discord at IceWaffles#3175 !
- I’m currently running a semi-vanilla survival server!
- I'll be uploading some basic files-eg very basic optimised configs for a public vanilla server.



-------------------------------------------------------

- vanilla <10 players | Standard minecraft software distributed by Mojang.
- Spigot 10-15 players | Allows use of plugins! Based off Bukkit (now CraftBukkit)
- Paper 15-25 players | Provides dupes and bug fixes over vanilla minecraft! Also a performance boost over spigot.
- Tuinity 25-50 players | 'Experimental' and 'heavy' optimisations. Fork of paper, which means it includes the dupes and bug fixes.
- Purpur 25-50 players | Based off Tuinity-only use if you need it's configuration options! Not recommended if you generally want a 'vanilla' MC experience.
- Airplane 50-100 players | Insane performance and optimisations. Do NOT use unless you have a very large server and must have the extra performance.
